        <h1 class="about--title">Who is Techhead?</h1>
        <p class="intro intro__para">Techhead is a small start up company that was created to help people get technology at a cheaper price then what you can find at other popular websites. We started with the idea that finding a reasonable price for families and others who can not normally afford technology is the correct thing to do. Which is why we offer our liftetime warranty at such a low price. We also offer payment plans if families struggle to make a one time purchase.

        <h2 class="para para__title">About Us</h2>
        <p class="para para__part2">
            Many of us at Techhead grew up with very limited access to computers and the internet. So creating this company was one of the biggest goals for us. Having the ability to give kids and others the chance at having a computer to use, play games on an xbox and enjoy the internet is a great feeling. <br>

            Creating a way that our customers can purchase technology that they couldnt afford normally was one of our biggest challenges. Luckily after working with some of the larger tech companies we have been able to purchase devices at a cheaper price. They've thankfully allowed us to purchase items directly from them which in turn allows us to give our customers a asking price. <br> 

            Our payment plans range from a few months to up to 5 years to pay off a device. With this wide range it allows most of our customers a choice in whether or not they can purchase an item from us. And with our lifetime warranty at such a low cost they can always come back to us if they have issues with their device(s).
